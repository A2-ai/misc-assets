> library(deldir)
> deldir 2.0-2 Nickname: "Partial Distinction"

     The syntax of deldir() has changed since version
     0.0-10.  In particular the "dummy points" facility
     (which was a historical artifact) has been removed.
     In the current version, 1.0-8, an argument "id" has
     been added to deldir().  This new argument permits the
     user to specifier identifiers for points.  The default
     behaviour is to continue using the indices of the
     points to identify them.  In view of the fact that
     point identifiers may be user-supplied, the arguement
     "number", in plot.deldir() and plot.tile.list(), has
     had its name changed to "labelPts", and the argument
     "nex" in plot.deldir() has had its name changed to
     "lex".  In addition the name of the forth component
     of the "cmpnt_col" argument in plot.deldir() has been
     changed from "num" to "labels".  There is a new
     function getNbrs(), and the function tileInfo() has
     been modified to include output from getNbrs().
     Please consult the help.

######################### Warning from 'xts' package ##########################

#

# The dplyr lag() function breaks how base R's lag() function is supposed to

# work, which breaks lag(my_xts). Calls to lag(my_xts) that you type or

# source() into this session won't work correctly.

#

# Use stats::lag() to make sure you're not using dplyr::lag(), or you can add

# conflictRules('dplyr', exclude = 'lag') to your .Rprofile to stop

# dplyr from breaking base R's lag() function.

#

# Code in packages is not affected. It's protected by R's namespace mechanism

# Set `options(xts.warn_dplyr_breaks_lag = FALSE)` to suppress this warning.
